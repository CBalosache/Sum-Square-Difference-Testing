# Sum-Square-Difference-Testing

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is: 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is: (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

The purpose of this project was to create methods that will calculate the difference between the above mentioned sums,
and create unit tests for the the methods used during that process. In the project I calculated the sums in two ways:
- For the first approach I used Loops
- For the second approach I used the mathematical formulas.

Overall I had to create 13 tests to make sure that everything works as expected.
